Link Management System


## Build
### macOS
Run on Release Mode

### Windows
Follow this [article](https://retroportalstudio.medium.com/creating-exe-executable-file-for-flutter-desktop-apps-windows-ea7c338465e) to build the .exe file. As said in [package instructions](https://pub.dev/packages/sqflite_common_ffi#windows) remember that in <b>release mode</b> you need to add the file sqlite3.dll [downlaod](https://github.com/tekartik/sqflite/raw/master/sqflite_common_ffi/lib/src/windows/sqlite3.dll) in same folder as your executable.

### Linux
Never tested
